### Overview

To get started we recommend following the tutorial (not yet available) using the example datasets included in /examples. We include image sequences acquired from a Femtonics microscope and standard tiff files of image sequences from a simple epifluorescent microscope along with corresponding CSV's containing stimulus information.

	> ***Importing Stimulus Data automatically from other sources.***
	> Mesmerize is flexible enough for you to import stimulus maps from other types of sources which you may be using. In order to import & automatically organize stimulus data from other source you will just need to add an additional *elif* block to the stimMaps setter method of the ImgData class in /MesmerizeCore/DataTypes. Refer to the property decorator of stimMaps for details on how stimulus data is organized. Briefly, each occurrence of a stimulus looks like this and is stored in a list containing all the occurrences of stimuli in that particular trace/image sequence:
	> `[['StimName', <pyqtgraph color object>], (startFrame, endFrame)]`
